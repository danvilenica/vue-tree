## Demos

Some basic demos are currently available. These will be expanded as time allows, though PRs are always welcome. As of 1.1.0, demos run with the version of the component that corresponds to the documentation. Prior to that, demos always ran with the latest component version.

Note that demos won't work in IE due to the way the component is loaded, syntax, Promises, etc.
